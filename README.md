# Vue 3 Personal Website

## Project Description
This is a personal website built using Vue 3 and Vite. The website includes multiple sections (Home, Projects, Contact) and interactive elements demonstrating core Vue features such as reactivity, two-way data binding, list rendering, conditional rendering, computed properties, watchers, and component-based architecture.

## Features
- **Home Section:** Introduces the user with a welcome message and includes a toggle for additional info.
- **Projects Section:** Displays a list of projects using `v-for` and uses a computed property to show the total number of projects. If no projects are available, a message is shown.
- **Contact Section:** Contains a form for users to submit their contact details with `v-model` and a watcher to log input changes. Form submissions are stored in `localStorage` to persist data on refresh.
- **Counter Component:** A simple interactive counter that increments on button click.
- **Animations:** Smooth fade transitions between sections using Vue's `<transition>` component.
